## About
The Hospital Management System (HMS) is part of the SC2002 (Object Orientated Programming) project, 
which is a Java console program designed to effectively manage a hospital's datbase by 
leveraging object-oriented concepts. Reusability, extensibility, and maintainability were 
prioritised in the program's design to facilitate future development and simple upgrades. 
In order to meet the needs of various user types, it offers flexibility.
